# Accordion

The Material UI Accordion component includes several complementary utility components to handle various use cases:

- `Accordion`: the wrapper for grouping related components.
- `Accordion Summary`: the wrapper for the Accordion header, which expands or collapses the content when clicked.
- `Accordion Details`: the wrapper for the Accordion content.
- `Accordion Actions`: an optional wrapper that groups a set of buttons.

## Elevation

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Elevation} />

## Simple

To use the `simple` variant, set the `variant` prop to `simple` on the `Accordion` component.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Simple} />

```tsx
<Accordion variant="simple">
  <AccordionSummary id="panel-header" aria-controls="panel-content">
    Header
  </AccordionSummary>
  <AccordionDetails>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
  </AccordionDetails>
</Accordion>
```

### When to Use `simple`

- Use when you need collapsible content within an existing container (such as a settings panel, side drawer, or form section).
- Use when you want the accordion to feel integrated into the surrounding layout rather than appearing as a standalone component.
- Use when a bordered, minimal treatment aligns better with the surrounding design than the default elevated style.

### When Not to Use

- Avoid when the accordion is the primary content on a page or screen—use the default accordion for clearer separation and emphasis.
- Avoid when elevation or background color is needed to distinguish content from the surface.

### Visual Differences

- No background fill or shadow
- Bordered outline for separation
- Minimal styling to reduce emphasis and support secondary usage

## Disable Padding

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.DisablePadding} />

```tsx
<Accordion variant="simple" disablePadding>
  <AccordionSummary expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}>
    <Typography component="span">Accordion 1</Typography>
  </AccordionSummary>
</Accordion>
```

## Acordion Summary

The `AccordionSummary` component is used to display the header of the accordion. You can use the `variant="column"` prop to change the layout of the header.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.AccordionSummaryColumn} />

```tsx
<Accordion variant="simple">
  <AccordionSummary variant="column" expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}>
    <Typography component="span">Main Header</Typography>
    <Typography component="span" variant="body2">
      Secondary text
    </Typography>
  </AccordionSummary>
  <AccordionDetails>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse malesuada lacus
    ex, sit amet blandit leo lobortis eget.
  </AccordionDetails>
</Accordion>
```
