# Accordion

The Material UI Accordion component includes several complementary utility components to handle various use cases:

- `Accordion`: the wrapper for grouping related components.
- `Accordion Summary`: the wrapper for the Accordion header, which expands or collapses the content when clicked.
- `Accordion Details`: the wrapper for the Accordion content.
- `Accordion Actions`: an optional wrapper that groups a set of buttons.

## Elevation

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Elevation} />

# With List

With a list inside the accordion.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.WithList} />

## Acordion Summary

The `AccordionSummary` component is used to display the header of the accordion. You can use the `variant="column"` prop to change the layout of the header.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.AccordionSummaryColumn} />
