# Elevation

Material UI provides elevation levels from 0 to 24, represented by shadows of
increasing intensity. Higher elevation values create more pronounced shadows,
giving the impression that elements are raised further from the surface.

To use the Elevation component, you can use the `elevation` prop to set the elevation level.
