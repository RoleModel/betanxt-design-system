# BetaNXT Connected Design System

This Storybook is the home for the BetaNXT design system's documentation, examples, and guidelines.

---

## What is this?

- **Theme Documentation:**
  Explore how our custom themes (`baseTheme` and `betanxtTheme`) extend and customize Material UI (MUI) components. All tokens, palettes, and design decisions are documented here.

- **Default MUI Components:**
  See how standard MUI components look and behave with our themes applied. This helps ensure consistency and provides a reference for usage.

- **Custom Components:**
  Discover our bespoke UI components, built to address unique product needs and use cases. Each custom component is documented with usage guidelines and examples.

## Goals of this Storybook

- **Documentation:**
  Provide a central, always up-to-date reference for our design system.

- **Developer Experience:**
  Make it easy for developers to discover, use, and implement both default and custom components.

- **Design Consistency:**
  Ensure a unified look and feel across all products by documenting theme tokens, component variants, and best practices.
