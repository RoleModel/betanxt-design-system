# Elevation

Material UI provides elevation levels from 0 to 24, on the `Paper` component and are represented by shadows of increasing intensity. Higher elevation values create more pronounced shadows, giving the impression that elements are raised further from the surface. Check out the [Mui Paper](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-paper/) documentation for more details.

To change the elevation of a component composed of `Paper`, you can use the `elevation` prop to set the elevation level.
