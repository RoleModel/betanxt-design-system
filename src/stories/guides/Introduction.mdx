# BetaNXT Connected Design System

Welcome to the BetaNXT Design System—your central resource for building consistent, scalable, and branded experiences across BetaNXT products.

## What's in this Storybook

- **Theme Reference**
  Learn how our themes work. The system is powered by `betanxtTheme`, which extends our foundational `baseTheme`. While `baseTheme` is not intended for standalone use, it serves as a scaffold for branded themes—modifying key tokens like `background.default`, `background.paper`, and various Data Grid and Table-related variables.

- **Default MUI Components**
  Preview standard MUI components styled with our theme to ensure alignment with BetaNXT design standards. These serve as the foundation for rapid prototyping and consistent implementation.

- **Custom Components**
  Explore a library of bespoke components tailored to our unique product requirements. Each one is documented with usage guidelines, variants, and examples.

## Our Goals

- **Centralized Documentation**
  Keep our system transparent, well-documented, and easy to reference for anyone involved in product design and development.

- **Developer Efficiency**
  Empower developers to confidently implement components and themes without guesswork.

- **Visual Consistency**
  Ensure a cohesive look and feel across all apps, products, and experiences by documenting theme tokens, component behavior, and best practices.
